Acknowledgement", " Introduction to R Gaby Mahrholz, Greta Todorova, Wilhelmiina Toivo, and Jaimie Torrance, updated by Johanna Werner in 2022 and Sean Westwood in 2023 2024-03-31 About this course This course is a short introduction on using R for dealing with data. Intended Learning Outcomes The Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) for the entire course are: Demonstrate how R and RStudio work by transforming and cleaning different types of data into an appropriate format for analysis and creating graphical representations to visualise different types of data; Calculate summary statistics using R; and Interpret common error messages and use in-built help facilities to debug their code. Each chapter contained within will come with its own specific ILOs which will be clearly specified at the top of each page. These ILOs will be the points that will be covered in the assessments. What will I need to complete this course? To successfully complete this course, you will need access to a computer that either already has, or you can download R and RStudio software on. This computer will need to use a Windows, Mac or Linux based operating system. You can run RStudio on a Chromebook sometimes, but the process is more complex (see here). If you cannot use RStudio on your computer you might want to consider using RStudio Cloud. All University of Glasgow Library computers should have this software installed. If you have enrolled in the University, you should have access to these. Before the first lesson you will be given the task of either installing R and RStudio on your own personal computer, or finding another suitable method of accessing the software. Full instructions will be given in Chapter 1 of this coursebook. If you are having issues with access, talk to your tutors via the via the Microsoft Teams channel as soon as possible so that we can help you! R, like any skill, will get better with practice and we want to ensure you can practice and complete the assessments as easily as possible. Why are these materials open?
